# Mealfall

A (poor-quality) knockoff off of Pou's Food Drop game. I mainly wrote this just because I wanted to experiment with pygame. God bless pygame and it's contributors, it's such a nice library to work with.

## How to play

First of all, why would you want to play this? Second of all, here's a guide to installing it and a basic guide on how to play it.

You'll need Python, [pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) and [platformdirs](https://pypi.org/project/platformdirs/).

Then just run `python3 mealfall.py` and enjoy.

You control the red rectangle at the bottom with your mouse, and you're supposed to collect as many of the green circles (food) whilst avoiding any red circles (yuck). If you miss 8 foods then the game is over.

This game does store high scores.

## TODO

1. Better graphics. A decent player instead of a red square and some things that you can (and can't) eat instead of green and red circles.
2. Adjust the difficulty? Maybe?
3. Shove ChatGPT somewhere into it to please the investors and techbros.
8023. Re-write in Rust (or x86 assembly if I hate myself enough to do it.)
